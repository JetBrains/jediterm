JediTerm
========

[![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JetBrains/jediterm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JetBrains/jediterm)


The main purpose of the project is to provide a pure Java terminal widget that can be easily embedded 
into an IDE.
It supports terminal sessions both for SSH connections and local PTY on Mac OSX, Linux and Windows.


The library is used by JetBrains IDEs like PyCharm, IDEA, PhpStorm, WebStorm, AppCode, CLion, and Rider.

Since version 2.5 there is a standalone version of the JediTerm terminal, provided as Mac OSX distribution.


The name JediTerm origins from J(from `Java`) + edi(reversed `IDE`) + Term(obviously from `terminal`).
Also the word Jedi itself gives some confidence and hope in the Universe of thousands of different terminal implementations.


Run
-------

To run the standalone JediTerm terminal from sources just execute _jediterm.sh_ or _jediterm.bat_.
Or use the binary distribution from the [Releases](https://github.com/JetBrains/jediterm/releases/) page.



Build
-----

Gradle is used to build this project. The project consists of 4 sub-projects:
* **terminal**

    The core library that provides VT100 compatible terminal emulator and Java Swing based implementation of terminal panel UI.

* **pty**

    The jediterm-pty.jar library that, by using the [Pty4J](https://github.com/traff/pty4j) library, enables a terminal for local PTY terminal sessions.

* **JediTerm**

    The standalone version of the JediTerm terminal distributed as a .dmg for Mac OSX.


Features

Open Source Origin and History
------
The initial version of the JediTerm was a reworked terminal emulator Gritty, which was in it's own turn a reworked JCTerm 
terminal implementation. Now there is nothing in the source code left from Gritty and JCTerm. Everything was 
rewritten from scratch. A lot of new features were added.

Character sets designation and mapping implementation is based on
respective classes from jVT220 (https://github.com/jawi/jVT220, Apache 2.0 licensed) by J.W. Janssen.


Standalone distribution relies heavily on customized Swing UI widgets taken from IntelliJ Community platform repository
(https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) by JetBrains.
